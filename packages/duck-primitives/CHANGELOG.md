# @gentleduck/primitives

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- a157bae: Fix arrow base component to use smooth bezier curve path instead of polygon. Correct `TooltipArrow` and `PopoverArrow` to use `PopperArrow` primitive instead of `PopperAnchor` (was rendering invisible). Fix `asChild` propagation to `Primitive.svg` that caused SVG to become a Slot and eject children.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 95638de: Audit-driven refactor across all 15 public packages. Closes type holes, hardens security boundaries, eliminates dead code, and dedups duplicated patterns.

  **Highlights**

  - `duck-docs` — CompiledMdxBody branded type gates `new Function(body)`; sanitizeSvg covers SMIL, unquoted javascript: URIs, nested script, CSS url(), bare iframe; code-preview tag + attr allowlists
  - `duck-registry-build` — safe-path containment at every fs sink; per-phase Zod cache schemas; JSON.stringify in generated TSX; cache manifest rejection on tamper
  - `duck-cli` — install pipeline path containment unified across add/init/update; env-var allowlist contract reconciled with one-time warning; aliases.ui regex validation
  - `duck-primitives` — `observe-element-rect` rAF loop guard (no leak when empty); `compose-ref` useCallback memo fix; popper forwardRef restored for R18 peer compat
  - `duck-hooks` — `useDebounce` is now a real hook (stable identity, unmount cleanup); `useStableId` delegates to React.useId (SSR-safe); `scheduleTransitionTimeout` rename strips two `useHookAtTopLevel` lint suppressions
  - `duck-lazy` — spread order fix restores the lazy swap; `next/image` moved behind `/lazy-image-next` subpath so non-Next consumers don't pull the peer
  - `duck-vim` — single document listener fans out to chord matcher + sequence manager; canonical modifier order; `requireReset` auto-clears for chord bindings; all three hook dep arrays corrected
  - `duck-variants` — `Props<T, D>` makes defaulted variant keys optional and non-defaulted required; bounded `preludeCache` LRU; second-layer `filter2` set eliminates last clone in hot path
  - `duck-ttest` — `predictates/` renamed to `predicates/`, twin dirs deleted, type-utility duplicates reconciled to canonical sources, `IsVoid` actually distinguishes void from undefined now
  - `duck-calendar` — `./*` wildcard export removed; falsy-zero `weekStartDay: 0` (Sunday) bug fixed; Gregorian helpers extracted; Hebrew `addMonths` uses Metonic cycle
  - `duck-libs` — `cnMemo` bounded LRU; `filteredObject` rejects typo keys at compile time; `parseDate` rejects ambiguous one-token inputs
  - `duck-query` — single AnyReq boundary cast replaces 14 `as any`; param regex escape; throws on unresolved `:tokens`
  - `registers` — schema tightened (`z.any()` removed); ~1000 LoC of identical block-registry boilerplate replaced with builders
  - `registry-ui` — `_audio` / `_upload` (~1.1K LoC) deleted; `motion-shell` HOC + `withMotion` collapses simple motion clones; `toDirection()` narrower replaces 52 `as IDirection.Kind` casts; chart `CSS_NAMED_COLORS` finite allowlist
  - `duck-motion` — refcounted body `pointer-events` ownership; easing/blur/duration token dedup; half of public exports were unused and removed

  Tests: 3133+ across the monorepo, all green. Type-checks clean across every project. No commits skipped hooks.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [95638de]
  - @gentleduck/calendar@0.4.0

## 0.2.14

### Patch Changes

- 95dbbce: Standardize README headers across all packages: centered logo, h1, tagline, nav links, and npm badges (matching the @duck-md template). Replace per-repo `*.gentleduck.org` subdomain refs with path-based `gentleduck.org/duck-<name>` URLs. No runtime code changes.

## 0.2.13

### Patch Changes

- 918b34c: Strip `workspace:*` and `catalog:` protocol tokens from `devDependencies`/`dependencies`/`peerDependencies` of every public package before `changeset publish`. Previously published artifacts leaked these tokens into npm metadata, which broke strict resolvers (bun, deno) for downstream consumers. Adds `scripts/clean-publish.ts` and wires it into the root `release` script with a `git checkout` restore step so source remains workspace-friendly.

## 0.2.12

### Patch Changes

- b4706d3: Replace `workspace:*` deps in published `dependencies` and `peerDependencies` with explicit semver. Previous publishes leaked `workspace:*` to the npm tarball, breaking `bun install` for downstream consumers (`error: Workspace dependency "@gentleduck/calendar" not found`).

## 0.2.11

### Patch Changes

- df57671: fix(slot): use cn() with twMerge in mergeProps for className resolution

  Raw string join caused conflicting Tailwind utilities (e.g. `inline-flex` vs `flex`, `gap-1` vs `gap-2`) to both appear in the final className, producing non-deterministic CSS and hydration mismatches when Slot clones client components like Next.js Link.

## 0.2.10

### Patch Changes

- 7d6fb7b: Align tsconfig shared configs, fix TS strict mode errors (exactOptionalPropertyTypes, verbatimModuleSyntax), align package.json deps to catalog refs, apply biome lint fixes.
- Updated dependencies [7d6fb7b]
  - @gentleduck/calendar@0.3.0

## 0.2.9

### Patch Changes

- 5136398: fix: popover and tooltip arrow components now use PopperArrow instead of PopperAnchor, fixing positioning when arrows are present
- Updated dependencies [32d0136]
  - @gentleduck/calendar@0.2.1

## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- 76e824b: fix: presence animation interrupt, breadcrumb keys, theme hydration, nested buttons

  - Presence: cancel in-flight exit animation on re-mount to prevent stale animationend from unmounting re-opened content
  - Breadcrumb: move key from BreadcrumbItem to Fragment (React key warning)
  - ModeSwitcher: use stable aria-label until mounted to prevent hydration mismatch
  - PopoverTrigger: add asChild to calendar-7 and combobox-7 to prevent nested buttons

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [58d1c61]
  - @gentleduck/calendar@0.2.0

## 0.2.6

### Patch Changes

- 6f0e067: Standardize package exports to use explicit named exports, add `sideEffects` field and `types` export entries to package.json, and annotate internal APIs with `@internal` JSDoc tags.

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 2b6e8d0: Resolve all biome lint warnings, improve type safety, and add test coverage across the monorepo.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- fix(search): disable primitive's built-in filter when using custom lunr search

  The command menu had two competing filtering systems: lunr-based search and the primitive's
  substring filter. The primitive's filter was hiding items via `el.hidden = true` even when
  lunr correctly found them, causing search results to not appear. Added `shouldFilter` prop
  to the Command primitive to allow disabling the built-in filter.

## 0.2.3

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4f93768: Fix compatibility with duck-gen output format and resolve build issues with generated component wrappers.

## 0.1.44

### Patch Changes

- d0a2c1d: Fix tooltip primitive behavior by removing click-toggle on the trigger.
