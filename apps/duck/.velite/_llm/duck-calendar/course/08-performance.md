**Lesson 8 of 8**: how `@gentleduck/calendar` compares to other React calendar libraries, plus optimization tips.

## Bundle size

We replaced `react-day-picker` with `@gentleduck/calendar`. Comparison against the major React calendar libraries:

### Bundle size — all competitors

| Library | Bundle (gzipped) | Improvement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **@gentleduck/calendar** | **4.9 KB** | **Winner** |
| react-calendar | 15.0 KB | 3.1x larger |
| react-day-picker v9 | 20.0 KB | 4.1x larger |
| react-datepicker | 32.0 KB | 6.5x larger |
| react-aria DatePicker | 45.0 KB | 9.2x larger |

### Dependencies

| Library | Runtime Dependencies |
| :--- | :--- |
| **@gentleduck/calendar** | **0** |
| react-calendar | 0 |
| react-day-picker | 1 (date-fns) |
| react-datepicker | 3 |
| react-aria | 8 |

## Render performance

Core function benchmarks (average of 2000 iterations):

| Operation | Time |
| :--- | :--- |
| `buildCalendarMonth` | ~8 us |
| `buildMultiMonth(3)` | ~22 us |
| `buildMultiMonth(12)` | ~78 us |
| `applySelection` | ~11 us |

Generate benchmarks locally:

```bash
cd packages/duck-calendar && bun run benchmark
```

## Package quality

| Tool | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| publint | All good |
| attw (are-the-types-wrong) | Types correct for node10, node16, bundler |
| ESM | Pure ESM, `"type": "module"` |

## Optimizations

These are the changes that took the core bundle from 7.0 KB down to 4.9 KB gzipped (75% smaller than react-day-picker):

- **Intl.DateTimeFormat caching** — formatters cached per locale+options, avoiding expensive re-instantiation.
- **React.memo on day cells** — prevents re-rendering 42 unchanged cells on selection change.
- **Stable keyboard callback** — `configRef` pattern, zero recreation cost.
- **Pre-computed time field orders** — 4 static arrays replace `Array.filter()` on every keystroke.
- **Frozen selection constants** — one `UNSELECTED` object shared across unselected days.
- **Dev JSX elimination** — production build uses `createElement` directly, no `jsxDEV` metadata.

---

## Why it's fast

- **Pure functions** — grid building and selection allocate no closures and hold no subscriptions.
- **No date library dependency** — `NativeAdapter` uses native `Date` and `Intl.DateTimeFormat`.
- **Tree-shakeable** — import only what you need; if it's just `buildCalendarMonth`, the rest goes.
- **Minimal React overhead** — hooks use `useMemo` to avoid rebuilding grids on every render.
- **No CSS runtime** — no CSS-in-JS overhead, no stylesheet injection.

## Optimization tips

}>

- Wrap day cells in `React.memo` to skip re-renders on unchanged days.
- Use `numberOfMonths: 1` unless you need multi-month views.
- Use `fixedWeeks: false` to render fewer day cells.
- Memoize the adapter instance outside the component — it's stateless.
