## API

### `Menubar.Root`

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | `string` | - | Controlled value of the currently open menu |
| `defaultValue` | `string` | - | Initial open menu (uncontrolled) |
| `onValueChange` | `(value: string) => void` | - | Called when the active menu changes |
| `loop` | `boolean` | `true` | Keyboard navigation wraps from last to first |
| `dir` | `'ltr' \| 'rtl'` | - | Reading direction for keyboard navigation |

### `Menubar.Menu`

Groups a trigger and its content into one menu entry.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `value` | `string` | - | Unique value identifying this menu |
| `onOpenChange` | `(open: boolean) => void` | - | Called when this menu opens or closes. Useful for integrating with animation libraries like `motion` |

### `Menubar.Content`

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `align` | `'start' \| 'center' \| 'end'` | `'start'` | Alignment relative to the trigger |
| `sideOffset` | `number` | `0` | Distance from the trigger |
| `alignOffset` | `number` | `0` | Cross-axis offset |
| `forceMount` | `true` | - | Force content to stay mounted. Useful for animation libraries |
| `asChild` | `boolean` | `false` | Render as child element instead of wrapper |
| `loop` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether keyboard navigation loops around |
| `trapFocus` | `boolean` | `context.open` | Override whether focus is trapped inside the content |
| `disableOutsidePointerEvents` | `boolean` | `context.open` | Override whether outside pointer events are disabled |
| `disableOutsideScroll` | `boolean` | - | Override whether scroll is locked when content is open |
| `onCloseAutoFocus` | `(event: Event) => void` | - | Called when auto-focusing on close |
| `onEscapeKeyDown` | `(event: KeyboardEvent) => void` | - | Called when Escape is pressed |
| `onPointerDownOutside` | `(event: PointerDownOutsideEvent) => void` | - | Called when a pointer down event occurs outside |
| `onFocusOutside` | `(event: FocusOutsideEvent) => void` | - | Called when focus moves outside the content |
| `onInteractOutside` | `(event: PointerDownOutsideEvent \| FocusOutsideEvent) => void` | - | Called on any outside interaction |

}>

The `forceMount`, `asChild`, `trapFocus`, `disableOutsidePointerEvents`, and `onPointerDownOutside` / `onFocusOutside` props give you full control over the content lifecycle. This is especially useful when integrating with animation libraries like [motion](https://motion.dev) — use `forceMount` + `asChild` to keep the content mounted during exit animations, and the outside-interaction handlers to prevent premature dismissal.

## Keyboard interactions

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| <Kbd>ArrowRight</Kbd> | Move to next menu in the bar |
| <Kbd>ArrowLeft</Kbd> | Move to previous menu in the bar |
| <Kbd>ArrowDown</Kbd> | Open menu / highlight next item |
| <Kbd>ArrowUp</Kbd> | Highlight previous item |
| <Kbd>Enter</Kbd> / <Kbd>Space</Kbd> | Activate item |
| <Kbd>Escape</Kbd> | Close menu |

All menu-level sub-components (Item, CheckboxItem, RadioGroup, RadioItem, Sub, etc.) work identically to Context Menu.
