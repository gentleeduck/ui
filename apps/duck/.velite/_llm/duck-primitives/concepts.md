}>

These patterns are the contract design-system wrappers should preserve.

## 1) Composition via `asChild`

`asChild` replaces the primitive's default DOM node with the child element, keeping
the primitive's behavior and semantics.

```tsx

```

---

## 4) Dismiss orchestration with `Dismissable Layer`

Dismiss behavior is event-driven, not hardcoded. Key hooks:

- `onPointerDownOutside`
- `onFocusOutside`
- `onInteractOutside`
- `onEscapeKeyDown`
- `onDismiss`

Cancel dismissal with `event.preventDefault()`.

Use this for guarded flows — unsaved changes, in-flight requests, multi-step
confirmation.

---

## 5) Mount lifecycle with `Presence`

`Presence` is how primitives support CSS exit animations without race conditions.

State model:

1. `mounted`
2. `unmountSuspended` (exit animation in progress)
3. `unmounted`

In practice: style enter/exit through `data-state` and CSS keyframes. Use
`forceMount` when an external animation library controls DOM presence.

---

## 6) Positioning contract with `Popper`

Floating primitives expose a stable placement API:

- `side`, `align`
- `sideOffset`, `alignOffset`
- `avoidCollisions`, `collisionPadding`, `collisionBoundary`

This is a layout API, not a styling API. Keep visual concerns in classes/tokens.

---

## 7) Context scoping and nested primitives

Primitives use scoped contexts so nested instances remain independent.

```tsx

      <Dialog.Content>Nested dialog</Dialog.Content>

```

When wrapper components fail in nested cases, the root cause is usually prop
swallowing or broken ref forwarding — not primitive context.

---

## 8) Data attributes are your styling API

Use data attributes for visual states and ARIA attributes for assistive semantics.

- `data-state="open" | "closed"`
- `data-disabled`
- `data-highlighted`
- `data-side`, `data-align` (floating content)

```css
[data-state='open'] {
  animation: fadeIn 160ms ease;
}

[data-state='closed'] {
  animation: fadeOut 120ms ease;
}
```

---

## 9) Wrapper design rules for design systems

1. Re-export Root directly where possible.
2. Wrap visual parts with `forwardRef`.
3. Preserve primitive props (`...props`) and `className` extensibility.
4. Set sensible defaults (`sideOffset`, animation classes, padding).
5. Keep accessibility defaults non-optional (title requirements, labels).

---

## 10) Debugging checklist

When behavior looks wrong, check in order:

1. Is `asChild` child a single ref-forwarding element?
2. Are you preventing dismissal/focus events unintentionally?
3. Did you move interactive nodes outside the expected layer/content?
4. Is controlled state updating synchronously?
5. Are exit animations defined for closed state when using Presence?
