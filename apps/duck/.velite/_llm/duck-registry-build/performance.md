registry-build is optimized for repeated local runs. Warm builds avoid touching
unchanged files, skip re-reading unchanged source content, and report real rewritten
file counts in the summary table.

## What is optimized

The performance model focuses on five things:

1. file-hash caching
2. skip writing identical files
3. incremental index and component rebuilds
4. bounded concurrent work
5. changed-only local rebuild mode

---

## Cache location

By default, the builder writes cache state to:

```text
<output.dir>/.registry-build/build-cache.json
```

Override it with:

```ts
performance: {
  cacheDir: '.registry-build',
}
```

The cache directory is local build state — keep it ignored by Git.

## How warm builds work

On warm runs the builder:

- Reuses cached file hashes when mtime and size are unchanged.
- Reuses cached index entries when signatures match.
- Reuses cached component payload decisions when signatures match.
- Skips component-index and colors writes when generated output is unchanged.
- Removes stale generated files when previous outputs disappear from the current
  build.

---

## `--changed-only`

Use this for local iterative rebuilds when you want the builder to lean on the
cache aggressively:

```bash
registry-build build --changed-only
```

Pair it with explicit changed paths if you know which files moved:

```bash
registry-build build --changed-only --changed ../../packages/registry-ui/src/button/button.tsx
```

The builder then narrows component rebuild work to affected registry items instead
of checking every generated payload.

`--changed-only` works best in editor-driven or watcher-driven local workflows. CI
should usually run a full build.

---

## Parallelism

The builder uses bounded concurrency for discovery and generation. Default:
`Math.max(1, Math.min(cpuCount, 8))` — CPU-aware, capped at 8.

Override it with:

```ts
performance: {
  parallelism: 6,
}
```

Lower it if the workspace lives on slower storage or if generated outputs compete
with another heavy process.

---

## When files are rewritten

The builder rewrites files only when generated content changes.

This applies to:

- `index.json`
- per-item component JSON files
- generated component index files
- colors/theme JSON files
- generated `themes.css`

On a true no-op warm build, the summary table usually shows `Files` as `-` for
every phase.

---

## Turning incremental mode off

```ts
performance: {
  incremental: false,
}
```

Only do this to debug cache behavior or compare against a fully uncached build.
Otherwise leave it on.

---

## Troubleshooting

  
    Warm builds still rewrite files
    

Check whether generated content is stable. Dynamic timestamps, non-deterministic
ordering, or unstable custom generators force rewrites even when source files
didn't change.

    
  

  
    changed-only still rebuilds more than expected
    

Make sure the changed paths map closely to the real source files in a registry
item. File-indexed sources narrow work more precisely than folder-level item
indexing.

    
  

  
    Where did .registry-build come from?
    

That's the local incremental cache directory under `output.dir`. Expected, safe to
delete, and should be ignored by Git.
