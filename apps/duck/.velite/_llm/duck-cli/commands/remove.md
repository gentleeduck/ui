## Usage

```bash
npx @gentleduck/cli remove [components...]
```

Deletes the component source files and prunes any npm dependencies that no other installed component still uses.

## Options

| Flag | Description |

## Examples

```bash

npx @gentleduck/cli remove carousel resizable

# Remove from a workspace
npx @gentleduck/cli remove sidebar --workspace apps/dashboard

# Skip confirmation
npx @gentleduck/cli remove dialog -y
```

## How dependency cleanup works

1. **Resolves the component's npm deps** — e.g. `dialog` declared `@radix-ui/react-dialog`.
2. **Scans other installed components** — does any still need `@radix-ui/react-dialog`?
3. **Removes if orphaned** — runs `bun remove` / `npm uninstall` on the unused packages.

The CLI never removes a dep you'd hand-installed yourself unless it's also declared by the component being removed.

## What stays

- Your custom edits to other files
- Imports from removed components in **your own code** — they'll error at compile time, you fix them
- Theme tokens written by `theme add`
- `duck-ui.config.json`

To uninstall the CLI itself: `bun remove -D @gentleduck/cli`.
