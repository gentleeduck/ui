## Workspace-aware CLI

When `duck-ui.config.json` has `"monorepo": true`, the CLI resolves the install target from:

1. The `workspace` field in `duck-ui.config.json`
2. The `--workspace` flag (overrides config)
3. Auto-detection from the nearest parent `package.json`

The CLI **validates** that the target workspace has `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` before installing.

## Examples

```bash
# Init monorepo
npx @gentleduck/cli init --monorepo --workspace apps/web

# Add component to specific workspace
npx @gentleduck/cli add button --workspace apps/dashboard

# Update all in workspace
npx @gentleduck/cli update --all --workspace packages/ui

# Remove from a workspace
npx @gentleduck/cli remove sidebar --workspace apps/dashboard
```

---

## Layout patterns

### Single shared UI workspace

```
apps/
  web/
  dashboard/
  marketing/
packages/
  ui/        ← duck-ui.config.json here
    components/
    hooks/
duck-ui.config.json   { "monorepo": true, "workspace": "packages/ui" }
```

Run all CLI commands from the repo root. The CLI writes into `packages/ui/components/...` regardless of where you invoked it.

### Per-app components

```
apps/
  web/
    components/        ← gets its own components
    duck-ui.config.json
  dashboard/
    components/        ← gets its own components
    duck-ui.config.json
```

CD into the app, run from there. Each `duck-ui.config.json` lives next to the components it controls.

---

## Validation

Before installing, the CLI checks:

- Target workspace exists
- `package.json` is readable
- `tsconfig.json` is present (the CLI doesn't try to write one)

Failing any check aborts with a clear error pointing at the missing file.

---

## CI / scripted setups

```bash
# In a workspace bootstrap script
npx @gentleduck/cli init \
  --monorepo \
  --workspace packages/ui \
  --project-type next \
  --yes \
  --all
```

`--yes` skips every prompt. `--all` installs the full component catalog.
